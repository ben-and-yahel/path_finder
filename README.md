## bonuses:

we have pleanty feachers in our pathfinder.
1. algorithem picker - pick the pathfinding algorithem

3. animation - choose whever you'd like to see how the algorithem thinks
4. template - generate a template for the algorithem
5. select row - a tool for select a whole row
## what we learn from this project?

In this project we learn a new laguge : javascrip, and we sharped our algorithems thinking skills.
