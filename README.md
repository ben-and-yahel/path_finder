well for the folks who don't know what pathfinding is, it basically a bunch of squares with barriers between them and an algorithm how tries to navigate between them from point A to B. 

## How to use:

first, choose the start and end point by clicking the right-button on a square. the click will mark the start in blue and the end in red.
Now enter some barriers by clicking on the left-button on a square. the click will make black and our path could'et make the way throw them.
**activate:**
to activate hit any button on your keyboard.
## bonuses:

we have plenty of features in our pathfinder.

2. reload button - reload your page
3. animation - choose whenever you'd like to see how the algorithm thinks
4. template - generate a template for the algorithm

In this project, we learn a new language: javascript, and we sharped our algorithms thinking skills.
